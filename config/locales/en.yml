      <b>1. GENERALLY</b>
      <p>1.1. Mosson ApS (hereinafter ”Mosson”) provides a subscription-based online service at www.mossonstable.com, or another website designated by Mosson from time to time (hereinafter the “Websiste”), via the application Mosson Stable, available at AppStore and Google Play, or such other app store from time to time, (hereinafter the ”App”) with the content and features available on the App from time to time (hereinafter the ”Service”).</p>
      <p>1.2. These user terms and conditions (hereinafter the ”User Terms and Conditions”) apply to agreements between Mosson and a natural person (hereinafter the “User”) with respect to the Service. Only natural persons who are 18 years of age and older may enter into an agreement with Mosson with respect to the Service. After the execution of the agreement, Mosson can, provided that statutory conditions for this are met, conduct a customary credit check and, based on the results thereof, withdraw from the agreement with the User. Mosson also has the right to refuse to enter into an agreement, or immediately terminate an agreement with a User if the User has previously breached Mosson’s contract terms and conditions. Mosson may, instead of declining to enter into or terminate an agreement that have been entered into or require the User to provide security for such User's obligations pursuant to the agreement. Mosson also reserves the right to conduct a credit check or obtain other information regarding the User following the execution of the agreement in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>1.3. These User Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy (hereinafter jointly referred to as the ”Terms and Conditions”) apply and are binding upon Mosson and the User. In order to obtain access to the Service, the User must confirm that the User has read and accepted the Terms and Conditions and sign up to the Service (the confirmation of the Terms and Conditions and the signing up jointly referred to as the “Agreement”). </p>
      <p>1.4. Once the Agreement has been entered into, Mosson will provide a confirmation thereof that will be sent to the e-mail address submitted by the User in connection with the User registering a user account according to section 4 below.</p>
      <b>2. SCOPE OF THE SERVICE</b>
      <p>Territory</p>
      <p>2.1. The Service is available worldwide (hereinafter the ”Territory”).</p>
      <p>Content</p>
      <p>2.2. The User obtains access to the content and features which are provided on the App from time to time, immediately after the User has ordered the Service and accepted the Terms and Conditions. Mosson strives to continuously improve the User's user experience. The Service and its content and/or features may therefore, in the future from time to time be replaced, modified or updated. Changes, modifications to, or updating of, the content and/or features of the Service and other changes to the appearance of the App are not to be deemed to constitute a modification of the Agreement or the Service.</p>
      <p>Subscription</p>
      <p>2.3. For a monthly fee, the User may subscribe and obtain full access to the content and features of the Service.</p>
      <p>2.4. Mosson may also offer prepayment of the Service for a certain period, which exceeds a calendar month, and the subscription will then automatically cease once such period is at end unless the User makes a new prepayment (hereinafter the ”Time-limited subscription”).</p>
      <p>2.5. Mosson may offer free use of the Service for a limited period under conditions specified in connection with the offer (hereinafter the ”Trial period”). The User can choose to terminate the Service, at any time during the Trial period, without having to pay for the Service. The Trial period may only be used if the User has not during the last twelve (12) months been a User or made use of a Trial period or any similar marketing offer.</p>
      <p>If the User has not terminated the Agreement during the Trial period, the Trial period will automatically, and without notice to the User, transform into a usual subscription for which the User must pay the ordinary subscription fee. If the User decides to not become a Paying User, the User must thus terminate the Agreement during the Trial period.</p>
      <b>3. USE OF THE SERVICE</b>
      <p>3.1. To be able to use the Service, the User must register a user account on the Website (see, further, section 4), have access to equipment, systems and connections in accordance with these User Terms and Conditions (see, further, section 5), and after the expiration of a potential Trial period, make payment in accordance with these User Terms and Conditions (see, further, section 6).</p>
      <b>4. REGISTRATION, USER NAME AND PASSWORD</b>
      <p>4.1. Registration of a user account is to take place on the Website.</p>
      <p>4.2. The User shall be responsible for ensuring that the stated information at the time of registration is correct, and update its user account with correct information when needed. Upon registration, the User may only provide information regarding debit and credit cards which are the property of the User.</p>
      <p>4.3. Upon registration, the User shall provide a user name and a password (hereinafter the ”Log-On Information”). The User's Log-On Information is personal and may not be used by a third party. The User shall store the Log-On Information in order to protect it against unauthorised access. The User is responsible for all use of the Service which takes place through the User's account.</p>
      <p>4.4. If the User suspects unauthorised use of the User's Log-On Information, the User shall immediately notify Mosson this fact and change the User's password. In the event Mosson has cause to believe that the Log-On Information has been disclosed or in some other manner is being misused by unauthorised persons, Mosson shall be entitled to immediately terminate the Agreement in accordance with section 12.5 (c).</p>
      <p>4.5. Mosson shall be entitled at any time to request that the User changes the User's password. Changes shall be effected promptly and may cause temporary disruptions in the use of the Service.</p>

      <p>5.1. In order to use the Service, the User must possess devices with sufficient access to the Internet, in order to access the Website, and the necessary equipment in order to download and use the App, i.e. up-to-date smart phones or tablets.</p>
      <p>5.2. The Service requires that the User has access to the necessary Internet connection. The User is responsible for all costs associated with such connection, including data traffic costs, irrespective of where in the Territory (see, above, section 2.1) the User uses the Service.</p>
      <p>5.3. Mosson is not responsible for the User's failure to use the Service or for access to the Service being limited due to an overload on the Internet or due to faults or problems relating to computers or other units, networks, electronics or communications.</p>

However, if the User has been entitled to use a Trial period, no payment must be made before the first day after the end of the Trial period, see further section 6.4. If Mosson offers a Time-limited subscription and the User chooses to subscribe to such subscription, the User shall pay the subscription fee for the entire relevant period in advance, see further section 6.4.</p>
      <p>6.3. The User may effect payment of the fee through any of the means of payment offered by Mosson on the Website. The User agrees to sign the necessary documents and, at each due date, keep sufficient funds for payment of the Service available through the selected means of payment.</p>
      <p>6.4. If the User is granted a Trial period, no payment shall be made for the period that constitute the Trial period. A first payment shall then instead be made on the first day after the end of the Trial period (provided the User has not terminated the Agreement before the end of the Trial Period) and thereafter the same day each month the following months. If the User has entered into an Agreement for a Time-limited subscription with a Trial period, payment for the entire relevant period shall be made the day after the end of the Trial period (provided the User has not terminated the Agreement before the end of the Trial period).</p>
      <p>6.5. If sufficient funds are not made available by the User on the date when payment is due, Mosson will again try to draw the fee from the credit or debit card that the User has stated, when paying by credit or debit card. If payment of the fee has not been made fifteen (15) days from the date the fee should have been paid, Mosson shall be entitled to issue an invoice for the relevant period, plus invoicing charges, or deduct the unpaid fee in conjunction with that the regular payment shall be made for the immediately following month.</p>
      <p>6.6. In conjunction with a delay in payment, Mosson shall also be entitled to charge penalty interest on the amount due in accordance with applicable law, statutory reminder fees and, where applicable, collection fees.</p>
      <p>6.7. If payment is not made on time, Mosson shall also be entitled to discontinue or limit the User's access to the Service. Mosson shall also be entitled to terminate the Agreement with immediate effect in conjunction with a delay in payment of more than twenty (20) days, and Mosson may at the same time issue a final invoice for all unpaid fees plus invoicing charges and statutory interest.</p>
      <p>6.8. In conjunction with payment by invoice (if Mosson offers payment by such mean), the User must pay an additional amount in accordance with the at each time applicable price list. The invoice due date is the last weekday of the month. Payment shall be deemed made when it has been received by Mosson.</p>
      <b>7. USE OF THE SERVICE</b>
      <p>7.1. The User may only use the Service for the User's own use and in accordance with these User Terms and Conditions. The User may not - and may not encourage, facilitate or cause any other party to - do any of the following:</p>

         e) otherwise use the Service in contravention of copyright laws or other laws.</p>
      <p>7.2. Use of the Service in violation of this section 7 shall at all times be deemed to constitute a material breach of contract which may result in Mosson terminating the Service with immediate effect (see, further, section 12).</p>
      <b>8. SOCIAL MEDIA</b>
      <p>8.1. Mosson may allow the User to make part of the User's user account available on social media such as, for example, Facebook and Twitter. In the event the User chooses to use this function, it may be possible for the public and other Users to see parts of the User's user account with respect to the Service. The User consents to such content being made available to the public and acknowledges that Mosson is not responsible for the content when it is available on social media.</p>

      <p>9.1. Mosson reserves the right to change the fees and other terms and conditions for the Service.

      <p>20.1. If Mosson refrains from requiring the fulfilment of a right under the Agreement or refrains from acting against the User's violation of the Agreement this shall not be deemed an authorization of the infringement or future similar infringements and shall not otherwise affect Mosson’s rights pursuant to the Agreement.</p>
